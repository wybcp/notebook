## 更新 18.04 LTS

### 更新现有的 packages

在服务器上运行下面命令升级包:

```

接着运行：

apt-get dist-upgrade -y
```

### 升级到 18.04 LTS

```

## 升级指南

    1. Update your current packages
    First, you need to update the packages on your current server by running the following commands:

    apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
    Run the following command:

    apt-get dist-upgrade -y
    To update all packages, which will add or remove packages and take care of dependencies.

    2. Upgrade to 18.04 LTS
    Although you can manually upgrade your server, many people prefer the “do-release-upgrade” tool which is provided by Ubuntu by default. The tool does everything automatically.
