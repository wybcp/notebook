#NGINX1.9.5 and later (and NGINX Plus R7 and later) supports the HTTP/2 protocol,
# and all you need to do is to enable it ðŸ˜€. 
#To do so, include the http2 parameter on the listen directives in your NGINX configuration files:

listen 443 ssl http2;

#You can verify that your (or any) site supports HTTP/2 with the HTTP2.Pro service:https://http2.pro/
